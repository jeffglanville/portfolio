    <h1>Jeff Glanville</h1>
        <h3>Mission Statement:</h3>
        <p>To take all I learn and apply critical information to fellow employees to be more accessible so clients and their employees are assisted better in the selection and decision when it comes to their health care needs through better interface design and user accessibilty.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I currently hold an associates degree in computer networking. I was in the computer networking field working on servers, printers, connecting company computers and interfacing the employee computer with the server. I got burned out and switched to the health and wellness industry. After four years of being in this industry I want to go back to my roots and expand on the knowledge I have and not only network with the computer but I want to design the look and feel of how the user will interact with websites. Once I have the full knowledge of all programming can teach me I feel the sky is the limit on all the industries I am able to assist.</p>
